# CI (Continuous Integration)

slime CI has two layers:

1. **Always-on CPU correctness tests** that run on every PR, every push to `main`, and manual `workflow_dispatch`.
2. **Label-gated GPU end-to-end tests** that validate real Megatron + SGLang training and rollout paths on self-hosted GPU runners.

This split is intentional. Most invariants should be checked quickly without waiting for the GPU fleet, while full training/rollout behavior is still covered by GPU e2e jobs.

## How It Works

The workflow is defined in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`, which is auto-generated from `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml.j2`.

### CPU Jobs

CPU jobs run on GitHub-hosted `ubuntu-latest` runners:

- `cpu-unittest` installs CPU PyTorch and lightweight dependencies, then runs registered unit and contract tests with `python tests/<test_file>.py`.
- `agent-adapter-test` does the same for agent adapter tests, with extra dependencies such as `openai`, `openai-agents`, and `anthropic`.

CPU jobs do not use Docker, do not acquire GPUs, and do not call `tests/ci/gpu_lock_exec.py`.

### GPU E2E Jobs

GPU jobs run on self-hosted GPU runners. Each job:

1. Starts a Docker container, usually `slimerl/slime:latest`; image validation uses `slimerl/slime-test:latest`.
2. Installs slime with `pip install -e . --no-deps`.
3. Acquires the requested GPUs with `tests/ci/gpu_lock_exec.py --count <num_gpus>`.
4. Executes the registered test file with `python tests/<test_file>.py`.

GPU tests usually follow the e2e pattern: `prepare()` downloads models/datasets, and `execute()` builds CLI arguments and calls `U.execute_train(...)`.

### Changed-Test Job

`run-ci-changed` dynamically detects added or modified files under `tests/test_*.py` and `tests/plugin_contracts/test_*.py` relative to `origin/main`.

For each changed test file, it extracts a top-level `NUM_GPUS = <N>` constant and builds a matrix. If `NUM_GPUS` is missing, CI defaults to `8`, so CPU-only tests should declare:

```python
NUM_GPUS = 0
```

The changed-test job itself runs through the self-hosted Docker path. When `NUM_GPUS = 0`, it runs the test without acquiring GPUs.

## CI Jobs and Triggers

| Trigger | Job | Type | Description |
|---|---|---|---|
| Automatic | `cpu-unittest` | CPU | Always-on unit and contract tests for argument validation, schedules, rewards, samples, rollout validation, checkpoint utilities, and plugin contracts. |
| Automatic | `agent-adapter-test` | CPU | Always-on agent adapter tests with optional provider SDK dependencies. |
| `run-ci-sglang-config` | `e2e-test-sglang-config` | GPU | SGLang config tests for advanced rollout engine deployment and mixed/offload scenarios. |
| `run-ci-megatron` | `e2e-test-megatron` | GPU | Core Megatron training tests covering dense, MoE, PPO, MTP, OPD, async rollout, PD/Mooncake, and debug replay paths. |
| `run-ci-precision` | `e2e-test-precision` | GPU | Numerical precision validation and parallel consistency checks. |
| `run-ci-ckpt` | `e2e-test-ckpt` | GPU | Checkpoint save/load correctness, including CPU/GPU optimizer states and async save. |
| `run-ci-image` | `e2e-test-image` | GPU | Runs the `run-ci-megatron` matrix on `slimerl/slime-test:latest`. |
| `run-ci-changed` | `e2e-test-changed` | Mixed | Runs only changed tests, using each file's `NUM_GPUS` value. |

`workflow_dispatch` can be used from the Actions page for manual validation. It runs the registered jobs according to the workflow conditions.

## CPU Unit Tests

The CPU suite is the first line of defense for correctness. It is designed to catch silent RL infrastructure bugs before a change reaches expensive GPU runs.

The registered CPU suite currently covers:

- Megatron argument and HF config validation;
- DP/CP scheduling utilities and CP loss invariance;
- metric reporting and distributed metric aggregation;
- reward-model grading utilities for math, GPQA, F1, DeepScaler, and DAPO-style math;
- `Sample` behavior, rollout validation, and agent trajectory merging;
- HF checkpoint saver behavior;
- customization hook contracts for rollout functions, generate functions, runtime hooks, and path loading.

Agent adapter tests are kept in a separate CPU job because they need extra SDK dependencies.

Useful local commands:

```bash
python tests/test_agent/test_trajectory_manager_branching.py
python -m pytest tests/test_megatron_argument_validation.py tests/plugin_contracts/test_plugin_generate_contracts.py
```

## GPU E2E Tests

GPU e2e tests validate the integrated training/rollout behavior that CPU tests cannot cover:

- `run-ci-sglang-config`: advanced SGLang deployment paths, including config-based engine layouts.
- `run-ci-megatron`: main Megatron backend coverage for dense/MoE recipes, async rollout, OPD, PPO-style paths, PD/Mooncake, and debug rollout-then-train replay.
- `run-ci-precision`: numerical consistency across parallel settings.
- `run-ci-ckpt`: checkpoint save/load combinations and async save.
- `run-ci-image`: the same matrix as `run-ci-megatron`, but on the release/test image.

Use targeted labels for routine PRs. Use `run-ci-image` sparingly because it consumes significantly more GPU time.

## Writing a New Test

### CPU Tests

For CPU-only tests:

1. Add the test under `tests/test_*.py`, `tests/utils/test_*.py`, or `tests/plugin_contracts/test_*.py`, following nearby patterns.
2. Add a top-level `NUM_GPUS = 0` if the file may be run by `run-ci-changed`.
3. Make the file executable directly:

```python
if __name__ == "__main__":
    raise SystemExit(pytest.main([__file__]))
```

4. If the test should run permanently, register it in the `cpu-unittest` or `agent-adapter-test` job in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml.j2`, then regenerate the workflow.

### GPU E2E Tests

For GPU e2e tests:

1. Create `tests/test_<your_test_name>.py` following the existing `prepare()` / `execute()` pattern.
2. Declare the required GPU count with `NUM_GPUS = <N>`.
3. Download required models/datasets in `prepare()`.
4. Build arguments and call `U.execute_train(...)` in `execute()`.
5. Register the test in the appropriate GPU job in `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml.j2`, then regenerate the workflow.

Example skeleton:

```python
import os
import slime.utils.external_utils.command_utils as U

MODEL_NAME = "Qwen2.5-0.5B-Instruct"
MODEL_TYPE = "qwen2.5-0.5B"
NUM_GPUS = 4

def prepare():
    U.exec_command("mkdir -p /root/models /root/datasets")
    U.exec_command(f"hf download Qwen/{MODEL_NAME} --local-dir /root/models/{MODEL_NAME}")

def execute():
    # Build argument strings and call U.execute_train(...)
    ...

if __name__ == "__main__":
    prepare()
    for proxy_var in ("http_proxy", "https_proxy", "HTTP_PROXY", "HTTPS_PROXY"):
        os.environ.pop(proxy_var, None)
    execute()
```

## Workflow Generation

The workflow file `pr-test.yml` is auto-generated from the Jinja2 template `pr-test.yml.j2`. Do not edit `pr-test.yml` directly.

To change the permanent CI matrix:

1. Edit `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml.j2`.
2. Run:

```bash
python .github/workflows/generate_github_workflows.py
```

3. Commit both `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml.j2` and the generated `.github/workflows/pr-test.yml`.

## Choosing Checks for a PR

- Pure argument parsing, reward, schedule, sample, trajectory, or hook-contract changes: rely on CPU tests first.
- SGLang topology or rollout engine deployment changes: use `run-ci-sglang-config`.
- Megatron training, loss, checkpoint conversion, or model recipe changes: use `run-ci-megatron`; add `run-ci-precision` or `run-ci-ckpt` when relevant.
- Docker image or dependency changes: use `run-ci-image`.
- New or modified tests: use `run-ci-changed` for quick targeted validation.
